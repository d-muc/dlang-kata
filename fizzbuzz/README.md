# FizzBuzz Kata

Implement the `toFizzBuzz` function such that all unittests succeed. The
function receives an integer and should return “FizzBuzz”, if the given integer
is divisible by both 3 and 5, “Fizz”, if the given integer is divisible by 3 but
not by 5, “Buzz”, if the given integer is divisible by 5 but not by 3, and a
string containing the given integer if it is divisible neither by 3 nor 5. 

Run the unittests with the following command:
```bash
dub test
```
